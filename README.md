# RGB Avoid Tearing Example

[esp_lcd](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/lcd.html) provides several panel drivers out-of box, e.g. ST7789, SSD1306, NT35510. However, there're a lot of other panels on the market, it's beyond `esp_lcd` component's responsibility to include them all.

`esp_lcd` allows user to add their own panel drivers in the project scope (i.e. panel driver can live outside of esp-idf), so that the upper layer code like LVGL porting code can be reused without any modifications, as long as user-implemented panel driver follows the interface defined in the `esp_lcd` component.

This example demonstrates how to avoid tearing when using LVGL with RGB interface screens in an esp-idf project. The example will use the LVGL library to draw a stylish music player.

This example uses the [esp_timer](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/esp_timer.html) to generate the ticks needed by LVGL and uses a dedicated task to run the `lv_timer_handler()`. Since the LVGL APIs are not thread-safe, this example uses a mutex which be invoked before the call of `lv_timer_handler()` and released after it. The same mutex needs to be used in other tasks and threads around every LVGL (lv_...) related function call and code. For more porting guides, please refer to [LVGL porting doc](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/porting/index.html).

## How to use the example

## ESP-IDF Required

### Hardware Required

* An ESP32-S3R8 development board
* A ST7701 LCD panel, with RGB interface
* An USB cable for power supply and programming

### Hardware Connection

The connection between ESP Board and the LCD is as follows:

```

                                       |                   |
                                       +-------------------+
```

* The LCD parameters and GPIO number used by this example can be changed in [example_rgb_avoid_tearing.c](main/example_rgb_avoid_tearing.c). Especially, please pay attention to the **vendor specific initialization**, it can be different between manufacturers and should consult the LCD supplier for initialization sequence code.
* The LVGL parameters can be changed not only through `menuconfig` but also directly in `lvgl_conf.h`

### Configure the Project

Run `idf.py menuconfig` and navigate to `Example Configuration` menu.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py set-target esp32s3` to select the target chip.

Run `idf.py -p PORT build flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project. A fancy animation will show up on the LCD as expected.

The first time you run `idf.py` for the example will cost extra time as the build system needs to address the component dependencies and downloads the missing components from registry into `managed_components` folder.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
